  <p id="img-caption"> It was on July 20th 1969, that the first man walked on the moon. It is by the far the most remarkable thing human beings have been capable of achieving. Although, it might seem that only a single goverment corporation like NASA, accomplished this stupendous achievement. But the real fact is, More than 300,000 scientists, professors, teachers and the like participated on the project. Landing man on the moon was a whole country's effort, not only a state department's achievement. However, currently highly capitalized companies are trying to repeat this astonishing deed with only their resources.</p>
